  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
     "previews/#{filename}"
  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url
  #   "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')
  # end

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process :resize_to_fill => [150, 150]
  # def scale(width, height)
  #  process :resize_to_fit => [width, height]
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :small do
    process :resize_to_fill => [120, 120]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
  # end

  #def filename
  #   "#{secure_token}.#{file.extension}" if original_filename.present?

  #def secure_token
  #  var = :"@#{mounted_as}_secure_token"
  #  model.instance_variable_get(var) or model.instance_variable_set(var, SecureRandom.uuid)
